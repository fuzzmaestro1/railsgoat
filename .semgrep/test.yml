      [best-practice]. Mongo DecimalField is not allowed for representing
      currency in models.

      Please use common.fields.CurrencyField instead, more context can be found in #currency-fields-v2-migration channel.

      Note for PR author: If field that you are adding is not representing currency then feel free to /ignore it, otherwise using new Currency type is mandatory.
